The tragic events of 2019-2021 are now forcing us to transform the way we live, 
          the way we collaborate and communicate. Now considering this situation,
          Russ Engineering is sharing their vision of what the businesses of design and engineering services segments
          should look like in the new post-pandemic world. We are on the verge of a new epoch and a different approach
          to carrying out large scale projects is essential.
          We are a new kind of a technology driven engineering consulting company:
          a team of freelancing professionals distributed around the world and anyone can join us! Our values revolve around the idea of
          a synergy among our diverse human talent and the drive to move progress further!
          Our philosophy is completely libertarian and altruistic, as humanity needs to shift the approach
          to providing goods and services to mobilize our capabilities in this new global economy we all will have to live in.
          Our team strives to utilize the most current tools at the cutting edge of information technologies and automation to improve
          the capabilities in creating new tools and built environment assets.
          We believe that in the current pressing situation, anyone who is ready to contribute a positive impact
          by inventing, innovating and creating new solutions that our planet has been begging for
          ever since the beginning of modern civilization, should absolutely put in the effort at this desperate
          time in the human history. Therefore, our online services operate on pure a client-specialist relationship basis.
          You have a problem? We have the solution for you!
